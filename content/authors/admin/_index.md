I am a PhD student at NYU Tandon advised by
[Lisa Hellerstein](http://cse.poly.edu/~hstein/).
I am broadly interested in algorithms,
complexity theory, and discrete mathematics.

I received my undergraduate degrees
in Mathematics and Computer Science from
Middlebury College.
At Middlebury, I designed quantum algorithms for graph theory
problems with [Shelby Kimmel](http://shelbykimmel.com/)
and worked on applications of math in recreational board games
with [Alex Lyford](http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/math/faculty/node/550503).
